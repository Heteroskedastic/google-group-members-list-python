# google-group-members-list-python-script
Just a python script that takes 3 arguments and returns members of a G suite group


So yeah,

the comments of the script need to be edited, I copy pasted bits of different scripts and did not edit the comments.

the 3 arguements in order required for this script are client_id, client_secret and groupkey

that's it for now!

enjoy
