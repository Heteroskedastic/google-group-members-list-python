# google-group-members-list-python-script
Just a python script that returns members of google groups.
You need to plugin your client id, client secret and domain into the code for it to work.

First run it without arguments to get authorized. Then you can run it with -c <group e-mail> or -a to get members of all groups.

k thanks
